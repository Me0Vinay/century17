| Column Name | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| image_front | Front angle photo | https://example.com/front.jpg |
| image_top | Top/aerial angle | https://example.com/top.jpg |
| image_side | Side angle photo | https://example.com/side.jpg |
| image_projection | 360° or projection | https://example.com/projection.jpg |
